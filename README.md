# Abstractüí°

* Our software modeling tool is aimed to design software development projects with the help of flowcharts and diagrams, to easily track, plan and make your software development process easy. Our software modeling tool focuses mainly on Flowchart diagrams, Timeline diagrams, FishBone diagrams, and Database model diagrams.
* The drag-drop feature makes the tool user-friendly. This tool simplifies the user operations and improves the intelligence of drawing. It also provides features like robust file compatibility, excellent file compatibility supports users to import and export drawings to a variety of file formats.
* It can run all features and templates identically on different platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Web. It supports a wide variety of diagrams to meet all your needs for business office, strategic analysis, human resources, engineering management and more.

# Project Descriptionüìò

* Our Software Modelling Tool helps you to make diagrams using ready-made symbols and templates and offers a complete range of business graphic documentation solutions.
* The tool mainly focuses on 4 types of diagrams namely, Flowcharts, Timeline charts, Fishbone diagrams and Database model Diagrams which are tailored for engine software projects.
* Our Software Modelling Tool is developed using Java and user interface is developed using Javafx.
* The tool also supports attributes such as reliability, maintainability and portability.

# Scopeüìà

Our project is a flowchart solution designed to help developers, network admins, IT analysts, and designers using drag-and-drop functionality to create and publish diagrams like flowcharts, mind maps, entity relations, network diagrams, and more. It has a large library of pre-built shapes. All shapes and clipart are vector format design, which means your scope diagram will never get blurred, irrespective of the size. The system enables users to align texts within the shapes and also import/export files of various file types making our tool user-friendly and flexible.

# Result and Discusionüí•

* We have spent the past 3 months designing and implementing the final product called Software Modelling Tool. The outcome of the project - Software Modelling Tool, is a tool that is useful to a wide range of users, it can be used by software engineers, students, teachers, managers, consultants and more. Our tool speeds up the strategic analysis and time spent in organizing it efficiently.
* The project was deeply studied and analyzed to design the code and implement. It was done under the guidance of the experienced project guide. All the current requirements and possibilities have been taken care of during the project time. 
* After carrying out the implementation of this application, we understand that its usage gives the user ultimate ease of access to various diagrams and templates all in one place. This application is an efficient and user-friendly product as the user will not have to explore and use several tools to make the required diagrams.
